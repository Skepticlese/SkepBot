# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: April 24, 2025_

SkepBot (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of users (“you,” “your”) of our Discord bot. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and disclose information when you interact with SkepBot.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

**a. Discord Account Data**  
- **User IDs**: Unique Discord user and guild (server) identifiers to associate balances, tickets, and custom commands.  
- **Username & Discriminator** (optional): Cached for display purposes only; not permanently stored.

**b. Bot State Data**  
- **Economy Data**: Coin balances per user.  
- **Lottery Data**: Ticket counts and pot amounts per user.  
- **Custom Commands**: Server-specific command names and response texts.  
- **Session Records**: Win/loss tallies and scoreboard history.

**c. Technical Data**  
- **Logs**: Minimal access or error logs for debugging and uptime monitoring.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

- **Provide Services**: Maintain user balances, run mini-games, and manage custom commands.  
- **Communication**: Send messages in Discord channels as you invoke commands.  
- **Debugging & Maintenance**: Diagnose issues and improve reliability using error logs.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- **Storage**: All data is stored locally on the bot host in JSON files (`commands.json`, `lottery_state.json`, etc.).  
- **Access Control**: Only the bot process and its administrator have access to raw data files.  
- **Encryption**: No sensitive personal information is stored; thus, encryption at rest is not currently implemented.  
- **Backups**: It is recommended that server administrators back up the `data/` folder regularly.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

- **Discord**: We rely on Discord’s API for authentication and messaging. Discord’s own Privacy Policy applies to your Discord account and usage: https://discord.com/privacy

---

## 5. Data Retention

- **Active Data**: Retained indefinitely unless cleared by server administrators or during a bot reset.  
- **Deletion**: To delete your data (balances, tickets, custom commands), remove or reconfigure the bot in your server and delete the corresponding JSON files on the host.

---

## 6. User Rights

- **Access & Correction**: You can view and edit your in-bot currency with `!balance`, or ask the server admin to modify/delete JSON entries directly.  
- **Data Deletion**: Contact the bot administrator or remove the bot from the server to clear stored state.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

SkepBot is not intended for users under 13. By using the bot, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old (or meet your local minimum age requirement).

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes take effect when posted. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
