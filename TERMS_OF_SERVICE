By inviting or using SkepBot (“the Bot”) in any Discord server, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use or invite the Bot.

2. Description of Services
SkepBot provides:

    A virtual economy (coins, balances, leaderboards)

    Gambling-style mini-games (slots, blackjack, weekly lottery with virtual tickets capped per user)

    Custom server-defined commands

    Session tracking with live scoreboards

All “coins,” “tickets,” and other rewards are virtual and have no real-world monetary value.
